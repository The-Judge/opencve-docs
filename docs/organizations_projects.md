# Organizations & Projects

## Organizations

In OpenCVE, an **Organization** is the highest-level object. Without an organization, a user cannot subscribe to products or vendors, nor receive notifications when a CVE appears or is updated.

Each user can belong to one or more organizations, with one of the following two roles:

- **Member**, who can manage subscriptions (vendors and products).
- **Owner**, who has full control over the organization, including managing memberships.

## Projects

An organization can have one or more **Projects**.

Projects allow organizations to organize their subscriptions and [notifications](notifications.md) in a way that suits their structure and needs. Here are a few common use cases for projects:

- An **MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider)** might create a project for each of their clients (e.g., client1, client2, client3).
- An **IT Companies** might create projects based on technical teams (e.g., team-X, team-Y, team-Z).
- A **smaller organization** could split projects by roles within the company, for instance, having one project for developers and another for sysadmins.

Each project operates independently and has its own dashboard to track the evolution of vulnerabilities in its subscriptions.

### Notifications

A project can also have one or more **notifications**. Whenever a CVE appears, or when an existing CVE is updated, and if this CVE is associated to one of your subscription, a notification is sent through the designated channel.

This flexibility allows users to be alerted through different channels (e.g., email, webhook) based on custom filters, for instance:

- all the changes are sent to an API using the webhook notification,
- and a mail is also sent on a mailing-list for all the CVEs with a CVSS score >= 9.

!!! note
    OpenCVE supports for now 2 types of notifications: `email` and `webhook`. Others are planned for future releases, such as `slack` or `opsgenie` ones.

### Reports

Projects include a **Report** tab, which provides a daily summary of the activity related to a project's subscriptions:

![OpenCVE Report](images/opencve-report.png){.center style="width:90%"}

This feature helps users stay informed about what happened with their subscriptions on a day-to-day basis.

!!! info
    Reports differ from notifications: notifications alert you in real-time when a CVE is updated, but only if it matches your filters.
    In contrast, daily reports include all CVE changes related to any product or vendor in your subscriptions, providing a broader overview of activity.
